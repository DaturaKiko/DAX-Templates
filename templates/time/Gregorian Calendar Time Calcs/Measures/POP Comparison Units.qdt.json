For example, Sum of Sales, or CYTD Sales.  See Base Measure or Period-to-date folders for those templates)\n\nB. Have a Show Value for Dates measure in your Date dimension that is hidden, but which controls how time intelligence calculations display in visuals.  See Show Value for Dates template to create.\n\nC. Have a Dates with Facts calculated column in your Date dimension, also hidden, that controls the filter equivalence between comparisons in current and previous periods. \n\nAfter that, you can use this template to build your period over period measure.  Be sure to specify the PeriodType, to specify year-over-year, quarter over quarter or month over month changes "
